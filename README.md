OpenLogistics is an enterprise-grade AI-driven supply chain optimization platform designed for mission-critical operations. Built with Clean Architecture principles, it provides intelligent autonomous agents for supply chain optimization, threat assessment, resource optimization, and mission coordination.

## Key Features

### AI-Powered Intelligence
- **OpenAI Agents SDK Integration**: Complete autonomous agent system with conversation history and intelligent decision-making
- **MLX Acceleration**: Apple Silicon optimization for sub-200ms response times
- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Specialized agents for different operational domains

### Enterprise Security
- **Military-Grade Encryption**: AES-256 encryption with Fernet implementation
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication with role-based access control
- **Classification Support**: UNCLASSIFIED through TOP SECRET security levels
- **Comprehensive Audit Logging**: Complete security event tracking

### Advanced Optimization
- **Neural Network Inference**: Advanced ML models for optimization scoring
- **Real-time Analytics**: Live performance monitoring and metrics
- **Multi-objective Optimization**: Cost, time, and resource optimization
- **Predictive Analytics**: Demand forecasting and risk assessment

### Production-Ready Infrastructure
- **Docker & Kubernetes**: Complete containerization and orchestration
- **Monitoring Stack**: Prometheus, Grafana, and custom metrics
- **High Availability**: 99.99% uptime design with failover capabilities
- **Scalable Architecture**: Support for 1000+ concurrent users

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Install from PyPI
pip install open-logistics

# Or install from source
git clone https://github.com/nikjois/OpenLogistics.git
cd OpenLogistics/open-logistics
pip install -e .
```

### Configuration

```bash
# Set required environment variables
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-key"
export SAP_BTP_CLIENT_ID="your-sap-client-id"
export SAP_BTP_CLIENT_SECRET="your-sap-client-secret"
export ENCRYPTION_KEY="your-encryption-key"
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from open_logistics.application.agents import AgentManager
from open_logistics.infrastructure.mlx_integration import MLXOptimizer

# Initialize agent manager
agent_manager = AgentManager()

# Start supply chain agent
agent_manager.start_agent("supply_chain", {
    "openai_api_key": "your-key",
    "model": "gpt-4"
})

# Optimize supply chain
optimizer = MLXOptimizer()
result = optimizer.optimize_supply_chain({
    "inventory": [{"item": "ammunition", "quantity": 1000, "location": "base_alpha"}],
    "demand": [{"item": "ammunition", "quantity": 500, "location": "forward_post"}],
    "constraints": {"max_cost": 50000, "max_time": 24}
})
```

### CLI Interface

```bash
# Start interactive CLI
open-logistics

# Agent management
open-logistics agent start supply_chain --config config.json
open-logistics agent status
open-logistics agent stop supply_chain

# Optimization commands
open-logistics optimize --type supply_chain --config optimization.json
open-logistics predict --type demand --data historical_data.json
```

## Architecture

OpenLogistics follows Clean Architecture principles with clear separation of concerns:

```
├── presentation/     # CLI, REST API, Dashboard
├── application/      # Use cases, Agents, Commands
├── domain/          # Business entities and rules
└── infrastructure/  # External integrations, databases
```

### Core Components

- **Agent Manager**: Orchestrates AI agents with lifecycle management
- **MLX Optimizer**: High-performance optimization engine
- **SAP BTP Client**: Enterprise system integration
- **Security Module**: Encryption, authentication, and authorization
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive observability and metrics

## Deployment

### Docker Deployment

```bash
# Build and run with Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d

# Scale services
docker-compose up -d --scale api=3
```

### Kubernetes Deployment

```bash
# Deploy to Kubernetes
kubectl apply -f k8s/

# Monitor deployment
kubectl get pods -n open-logistics
kubectl logs -f deployment/open-logistics-api
```

### Production Configuration

The platform supports multiple deployment environments:

- **Development**: Local development with hot reload
- **Staging**: Pre-production testing environment
- **Production**: High-availability production deployment

## Testing
